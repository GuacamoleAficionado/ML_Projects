    This was part of an undergraduate research project. Unfortunately,
    I was unable to include any of the actual data
    in the presentation. About half-way through the project, the 
    legal department of the company we were working with decided
    that in order for us to continue to have access to the data,
    the advising professor would have to sign a non-disclosure 
    agreement and we were not allowed to mention the name of the 
    company in relation to this project, etc.
